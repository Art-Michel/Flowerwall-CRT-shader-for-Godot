# Flowerwall-CRT-shader-for-Godot
My take on a CRT Shader for Godot, inspired by CRT-Royale.
Aims to emulate a grid mask among other things, works at any resolution but the higher it is, the crispier it will look, I recommand adjusting blurring (higher blur on a higher res monitor).

The demo project comes with a small configuration UI scene if you want to play around with some parameters.
If you change noise and scanlines, consider adjusting brightness and/or bloom intensity so it still looks natural.

How to use: just enable the plugin, an autoload is then loaded, preconfigured. Alternatively disable the autoload and just throw scenes/flowerwall_pp.tscn anywhere
